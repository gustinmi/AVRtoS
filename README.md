# AVRtoS

AVR - Arduino Realtime operating system. Realtime scheduler written in assembler. Optimized for performance, with keyboard and LCD display driver. 

Arduino realtime operating system with support for 4x4 keyboard driver, LCD driver, stepper motor driver, ADC and Serial driver. Uses a realtime interrupot scheduler for implementing non blocking drivers.

Originally written as a port of Motorola's 68HC11 operating system. Main purpose is learning the ATMEGA 328PU internals and to get glimpse into realtime kernel design.

Project includes some important concepts as a separete modules, meant only as learning experience.
